Instead of traditional ownership models where a single entity or a group of investors own the entire hotel, community ownership involves a broader group of individuals or stakeholders who own independent hotel rooms, and share ownership rights and responsibilities.",

    desc: "A Community-Owned Hotel involves diverse local stakeholders collectively owning and making decisions for the hotel, fostering community engagement and reinvesting profits locally. In contrast, traditional ownership models are typically centralized, owned by a single entity or investor group, with decision-making and benefits focused on profitability rather than community involvement. Community-owned hotels prioritize sustainability, aligning with local values, while profits are shared among stakeholders. Traditional models may lack this emphasis on community-driven values and shared prosperity, making the community-owned approach a more inclusive and locally focused alternative.",
