        Having the financial capacity to independently build a hotel is
        commendable, however, investing in Pieme Residences offers unique
        advantages, including risk diversification. Unlike owning a hotel in one
        location and country, which concentrates risk, Pieme Residences allows
        investors to spread their capital across multiple residences and
        projects to be built across Africa. This diversification minimizes the
        impact of potential issues in a single location, offering a more
        resilient and secure investment strategy. The community-owned model,
        managed by Pie Tech Limited, fosters shared decision-making, providing
        investors with up to 70% of nightly booking fees. This hands-free
        approach ensures passive income without the operational responsibilities
        of independent hotel ownership. With strategic location selection,
        blockchain technology integration, and an innovative investment concept,
        Pieme Residences stands as a modern, collaborative, and risk-mitigating
        approach to hotel room and hotel investment.

        More so, while it's expensive and challenging to rapidly expand hotels
        and general investments across different countries independently, Pieme
        Residences provides a seamless avenue for investors to diversify across
        the African continent easily. Unlike the tedious process of individually
        visiting countries, dealing with paperwork, and obtaining work permits,
        investing in Pieme Residences allows for effortless expansion. Investors
        can own hotel rooms in various cities like Mombasa, Dar es Salaam,
        Kigali, and other countries where Pieme Residences will be established.
        The investor doesn't need to navigate the complexities of international
        bureaucracy; a simple investment in Pieme Residences to be established
        in those countries is all it takes to start. This ease of expansion,
        combined with the benefits of a community-owned model and
        profit-sharing, positions Pieme Residences as a convenient and lucrative
        investment opportunity across diverse African locations.

        Pieme Residences, a pioneering initiative by Pie Tech Limited, operates
        as community-owned hotel apartments leveraging Blockchain technology.
        The process begins with meticulous location research, land acquisition,
        and an open invitation for individuals to invest in and own specific
        hotel units (Rooms). Investors become stakeholders in the project,
        benefiting from shared profits.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        Pieme Residences takes charge of comprehensive management, marketing,
        and maintenance, providing a hassle-free experience for the investing
        community. The groundbreaking aspect lies in investors receiving up to
        70% of the booking fee for each night their unit (room) is booked. This
        hands-free approach allows the community to passively enjoy daily
        earnings without direct involvement.

        The utilization of Blockchain ensures transparency, secure ownership
        records, and smart contract functionalities, enhancing trust in the
        investment process. Pieme Residences thus redefines community-owned real
        estate, offering a seamless and profitable experience for investors who

        Community-owned hotels may pose challenges such as complex
        decision-making processes, potential disagreements among stakeholders,
        and limited control for individual investors. Profit distribution might
        be subject to community agreements, impacting personal returns.
        Additionally, community projects may face slower decision
        implementation, and conflicts could arise due to differing investor

        A Community-Owned Hotel involves diverse local stakeholders collectively
        owning and making decisions for the hotel, fostering community
        engagement and reinvesting profits locally. In contrast, traditional
        ownership models are typically centralized, owned by a single entity or
        investor group, with decision-making and benefits focused on
        profitability rather than community involvement. Community-owned hotels
        prioritize sustainability, aligning with local values, while profits are
        shared among stakeholders. Traditional models may lack this emphasis on
        community-driven values and shared prosperity, making the
        community-owned approach a more inclusive and locally focused
        alternative.

        Hotel Community Ownership refers to a unique concept where a community
        collectively owns or invests in a hotel property. Instead of traditional
        ownership models where a single entity or a group of investors own the
        entire hotel, community ownership involves a broader group of
        individuals or stakeholders who own independent hotel rooms, and share
        ownership rights and responsibilities.

          <b>Shared Ownership: </b> Multiple individuals or entities contribute
          funds to collectively own the hotel. This can include residents,
          businesses, and even visitors who want to invest in and have a stake
          in the hotel.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base">
          <b>Participatory Decision-Making: </b>Community members may have a say
          in the decision-making processes related to the hotel. This could

          community engagement initiatives.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base">
          <b>Local Engagement: </b>Community-owned hotels often prioritize local
          engagement and benefit the surrounding community. Profits generated by
          the hotel can be reinvested locally, supporting economic development
          and community projects.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base">
          <b>Sustainability: </b>Community-owned hotels may have a stronger

        </li>
        <li className="text-base">
          <b>Shared Benefits: </b>Profits from the hotel are distributed among
          the community stakeholders, fostering a sense of shared prosperity and
          encouraging active involvement in the success of the enterprise.
          Overall, hotel community ownership aims to create a more inclusive and
          collaborative approach to hotel management, where the interests of the
          community are integral to the success and sustainability of the
